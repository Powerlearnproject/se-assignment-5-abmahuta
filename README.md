   - **Conditional Breakpoints:** Pause execution only if certain conditions are met (right-click the breakpoint and select `Edit Breakpoint`).

2. **Watch Variables:**
   - **Watch Expressions:** Add variables or expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values during debugging.

3. **Call Stack:**
   - **View Call Stack:** See the current call stack and navigate through the stack frames to understand the sequence of function calls.

4. **Debug Console:**
   - **Execute Commands:** Use the Debug Console to execute commands and evaluate expressions during debugging.

5. **Step Controls:**
   - **Step Over:** Execute the current line and move to the next line.
   - **Step Into:** Enter the function call on the current line and pause execution inside the function.
   - **Step Out:** Complete the execution of the current function and return to the calling function.
   - **Continue:** Resume execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

6. **Variable Inspection:**
   - **Variables Panel:** View and inspect the current values of local and global variables.

7. **Debugging Toolbar:**
   - **Control Execution:** Use the toolbar to start, stop, pause, and continue execution, as well as to navigate through code.

### Example Debugging Session

1. **Open Project:**
   - Open your JavaScript project in VS Code.

2. **Create a Launch Configuration:**
   - Click on the Debug icon (`Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Click `create a launch.json file` and select `Node.js` if you are debugging a Node.js application.
   - VS Code creates a `launch.json` file with default settings.

3. **Set a Breakpoint:**
   - Open `app.js` and click to the left of line numbers to set a breakpoint on a line of code.

4. **Start Debugging:**
   - Press `F5` or click the green play button in the Debug view.
   - The program will start, and execution will pause at the breakpoint.

5. **Inspect Variables and Control Execution:**
   - Use the Variables section to inspect variable values.
   - Use the Step Over, Step Into, and Continue buttons in the debugging toolbar to control execution.

By following these steps and utilizing these features, you can effectively debug your programs in VS Code and identify and resolve issues in your code.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    ## Integrating Git with VS Code for Version Control

### Initializing a Git Repository

1. **Open Your Project:**
   - Launch VS Code and open the folder or workspace you want to version control with Git.

2. **Open the Source Control View:**
   - Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`.

3. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   - Click on the `Initialize Repository` button in the Source Control view. If the button is not visible, you may need to open a folder that is not already a Git repository.
   - VS Code will create a new `.git` folder in your project directory, initializing it as a Git repository.

### Making Commits

1. **Stage Changes:**
   - **View Changes:** In the Source Control view, you will see a list of changed files under the "Changes" section.
   - **Stage Changes:** Click the `+` icon next to each file to stage the changes, or click the `+` icon next to "Changes" to stage all changes at once.

2. **Create a Commit:**
   - **Enter Commit Message:** In the "Message" input box at the top of the Source Control view, enter a meaningful commit message describing the changes you made.
   - **Commit Changes:** Click the checkmark icon (`✓`) to commit the staged changes. Alternatively, press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit.

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Connect to GitHub:**
   - **Open the Command Palette:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
   - **Search for GitHub Authentication:** Type `GitHub: Sign In` and select it to authenticate with GitHub if you haven't already.
   - **Follow Authentication Instructions:** Follow the prompts to authenticate with GitHub (this may involve logging in through your web browser).

2. **Add Remote Repository:**
   - **Open the Terminal:** Press `` Ctrl+` `` to open the integrated terminal.
   - **Add Remote URL:** Run the following command to add a remote repository:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
     ```
     Replace `yourusername` and `your-repository` with your GitHub username and repository name.

3. **Push Changes:**
   - **Push to Remote Repository:** Run the following command to push your local commits to the GitHub repository:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin master
     ```
     This will push the commits to the `master` branch on GitHub. If you're using a different branch, replace `master` with the name of your branch.

### Example Workflow

1. **Initialize Repository:**
   - Open VS Code and your project folder.
   - Click on the Source Control icon.
   - Click `Initialize Repository` to create a new Git repository.

2. **Stage and Commit Changes:**
   - Make changes to your files.
   - In the Source Control view, click the `+` icon next to the changed files to stage them.
   - Enter a commit message in the "Message" input box and click the checkmark icon to commit.

3. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+`).
   - Add the remote repository using the `git remote add` command.
   - Push your changes with `git push -u origin master`.

By integrating Git with VS Code, users can efficiently manage version control and collaborate on projects using GitHub, all within the VS Code environment.
